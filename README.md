Unemployment Analysis during COVID-19 in India
Unemployment Analysis

Project Overview
The Unemployment Analysis during COVID-19 in India is a data science project that focuses on analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates in various regions of India. The project utilizes Python programming along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization. The dataset used in the project contains information about unemployment rates, dates, and regions.

Project Highlights
Data Loading and Cleaning: The project begins by loading the unemployment dataset from a CSV file using the Pandas library. The data is then cleaned by handling null values and removing any unnecessary spaces from column names.

Temporal Analysis: The date column in the dataset is converted into a datetime format to extract relevant temporal features. The year and month are extracted from the date and added as new columns to facilitate analysis.

Visualization: Various visualizations are created to provide insights into the unemployment data. A count plot is used to visualize the distribution of unemployment rates based on different regions. Scatter plots are utilized to highlight states with high unemployment rates and to compare unemployment rates across regions.

Yearly Trends: The dataset is further aggregated on a yearly basis, calculating the mean unemployment rate for each year. This aggregated data is presented using a stylish background gradient to emphasize trends over the years.

Key Visualizations
Unemployment Rate based on Area: This visualization presents a count plot depicting the distribution of unemployment rates across different regions in India. It offers an overview of the unemployment landscape.

States with High Unemployment Rate: A scatter plot is used to showcase states with notably high unemployment rates. The x-axis represents the estimated unemployment rate, while the y-axis displays regions. The hue parameter distinguishes areas.

High Unemployment Rate States (>50%): Building upon the previous scatter plot, this visualization focuses specifically on states with an estimated unemployment rate exceeding 50%. It provides a more detailed view of regions facing significant unemployment challenges.

Yearly Unemployment Rate Trends: The yearly trends in unemployment rates are captured through a background gradient-styled table. This concise representation makes it easy to identify patterns and shifts in unemployment rates over the years.

Conclusion
The Unemployment Analysis during COVID-19 in India project showcases how data science techniques can be applied to understand the impact of external events, such as the pandemic, on critical socio-economic factors like unemployment. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and trend analysis, the project contributes to a better understanding of the evolving unemployment landscape in India during challenging times.
